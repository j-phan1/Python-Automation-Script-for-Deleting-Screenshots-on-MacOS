# Python-Automation-Script-for-Deleting-Screenshots-on-MacOS
This repository was created for a python automation script that automatically deletes screenshots in MacOS after 1 hour. I often take many screenshots on my Mac which I never keep. I figured why not create a script that automatically does it for me so the screenshots do not take up memory on my computer.
